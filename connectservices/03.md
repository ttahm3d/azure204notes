# Using Azure Storage Queue

It is used when we need a reliable messaging service between sender and reciever and the data reqirements are very high (upto 80GB). If the

Azure Queue Storage is a high performance buffer between Sender and Reciever

- It is a azure service that implements cloud based queues
- Application components access using REST API or Azure Client Library
- Senders add messages to queue
- Recievers remove the messages from the queue

Pricing is based on queue size and number of operations.

## Why to use queues?

- They store messages in them until a reciever is available
- A single queue can be up to 500 TB in size
- It can handle upto 2000 messages per second
- Allow app to scale automatically

## Messages

- Message is a byte array of 64KB size
- Support xml or JSON format for structuring message

## Creating a storage account

- Open Portal
- Create a storage account
- Settings for queues
  - Queues are part of genaral-purpose azure storage accounts. Cannot add them to blob storage
  - Access tier setting is applicable only to BLobs
  - Data replication
    - LRS - Locally Redundant storage - copied to disk in same data center
    - GRS - Globally Redundant Storage - copied to multiple data centers
  - performance
    - standard uses magnetic drives
    - premium uses SSD

## Using Queues

To access a queue, you need three pieces of information:

- Storage account name
- Queue name
- Authorization token

### Queue Identity

storage account name + Queue Name = QUeue identity

## Authorizing access

All requests to Queue must be authorized

1. Azure Active Directory - RBAC
2. Shared Key - account key of storage account
3. Shared Access signature - It is a URI that provides limited access to objects in storage account

Getting list of keys

```
az storage account keys list
```

You access a queue using a REST API. To do this, you'll use a URL that combines the name you gave the storage account with the domain `queue.core.windows.net` and the path to the queue you want to work with. For example: `http://<storage account>.queue.core.windows.net/<queue name>`. An Authorization header must be included with every request. The value can be any of the three authorization styles.

## Accessing the queue

Queue holds the message whose structure is known to both sender and reciever

We can use Azure Client Library for Dotnet core to connect and use Queue storage. It has type for each of the objects

- CloudStorageAccount represents your Azure storage account.
- CloudQueueClient represents Azure Queue storage.
- CloudQueue represents one of your queue instances.
- CloudQueueMessage represents a message.
