# Choosing messaging model to connect services

Azure provides technologies such as

- Azure Event Hub
- Azure Event Grid
- Storage Queues
- Service Bus

to allow various services to connect / interact with each other.

In distributed applications communication is one of the main concerns. If there is a drop of message between front end and back end Applicaiton will be out of sync.

There are two types of communication between azure services.

1. They can send messages - raw data. It is the data itself
2. They can raise events

## Choosing messages or events

### Message

- Message contains raw data
- contains data itself. not the reference to data
- The sending component expects the recieving component to process data in a particular way
- Use when there is a gurantee that a reciever is looking for that data

Eg: Picture upload. Picture needs to be sent as payload

### Events

Events are light weight than messages, mostly used for broadcast.

- Publisher - sending the event
- Subscriber - reciever

With events recieving components will choose which events to listen to and they subscribe to such events. Subscriptions are managed by event grid or event hub

- Lightweight notification that indicates something has happened
- Can be sent to multiple recievers at once
- Publisher has no expectation on the event being recieved

## Message based delivery

Two options are available

- Auzre Queue Storage - it is a service that is used to store large number of messages in a queue. That can be accessed securely using REST API. Limited only by the storage account on which it runs, they can contain millions of messages

- Azure Service Bus

  - Auzre Service Bus Queues - Service bus is a messaging system for enterprise applications. They use multiple protocols and are built on top of a messaging infrastructure designed for such services

  - Auzre service bus topics - These are like queues but multiple subscribers. Messages are sent to a topic instead of a queue. Topics have subscription which is inturn a queue. Messages are sent to all subscribers of the topic

### Advantages of queues

- Increased reliability - messages wait in queue until reciever is ready to accept
- Message delivery gurantee
  - At least once delivery -
  - At most once delivey
  - First in first out
- Transactional support - grouping of closely related messages

Use Service Bus topics if you:

- Need multiple receivers to handle each message

Use Service Bus queues if you:

- Need a delivery gurantee
- transactions support
- recieve messages without polling the queue
- 64 KB > message size > 256 KB
- Max size of queue; 80GB

Use Queue storage if you:

- Need to audit
- Queue size > 80GB

**Use Storage queues when you want a simple and easy-to-code queue system. For more advanced needs, use Service Bus queues. If you have multiple destinations for a single message, but need queue-like behavior, use Service Bus topics.**

## Azure Event Grid

Event grid is one of the Publish subscribe communication models prvoided by Azure. You need to notify all the users who have subscribed to a topic, such cases it is useful to use Event grid.

### What is Event Grid?

Event Grid is the fully managed event routing in Azure running on top of Azure service fabric. It distributes events from various sources to recievers.

- Dynamically scalable
- low cost system
- One to many relationship

1. Event - Something that happened
2. Event Sources - where event occurs
3. Topics: Where Publishers send events
4. Event Subscriptions: built in mechanism to route events
5. Event handlers: App or sevice reacting to events

The following illustration shows an Azure Event Grid positioned between multiple event sources and multiple event handlers. The event sources send events to the Event Grid and the Event Grid forwards relevant events to the subscribers. Event Grid use topics to decide which events to send to which handlers. Events sources tag each event with one or more topics, and event handlers subscribe to the topics they are interested in.

### Events

There are data messages that describe what has taken place. **MAX Size 64Kb**

```
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

- topic - path to event source
- Subject - publisher defined path to event source
- id -unique value identifying the event
- eventType - type of Event : httpRequestRecieved
- eventTime - Data Time in UTC
- data - info about event
- version of schema
- version of metadata by event grid

### Event Source

- Responsible for sending event to Event Grid
- Event Grid has a event Published - user or org who creates events

### Event Topics

- public endpoint that recieves event
- Categorize events into groups
- Event source send events to Event topics

1. System Topics - Builtiin topics provided by Azure
2. Custom Topics - created by users or apps

### Event Subscription

Event Subscriptions define which events on a topic an event handler wants to receive. A subscription can also filter events by their type or subject, so you can ensure an event handler only receives relevant events

### Event Handlers

Component that can recieve events from Event grid

## Event Sources

- Azure Subcription and Resources
- Container Registery
- Event Hub
- Service Bus
- Storage accounts
- Custom sources

## Event handlers

Azure Functions, WebHooks, Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft power Automate can handle events

### When to use

- Simplicity
- Event retires upto 24 hrs
- Advanced filtering
- Fanout architecture
- Pay per event

---

## Azure Event Hub

Certain service produce lot of events. Event hub is used to recieve and process millions of events. Fully Managed.

It is an Intermediatary for Pub-Sub modal. It is optimised for high throughput and resiliency

- Realtime batch processing
- Volume variety and Velocity
- Support for many languages
-

### Partitions

- Event Hub groups the incoming events in Partitions (buffers).
- Events are not missed as they are included in partition waiting for recievers
- The are in buffer for 24hrs and automaticlly expire after that
- Each event has atleast 2 partitions and each partition has a separate set of subscribers

### Capture

They can be stored in Azure Data lake or Blob for permanent storage

### Authentication

App publishers are issued an authentication token

Choose Event Hubs if:

- You need to save a stream of events to Data Lake or Blob storage.
- You need to support authenticating a large number of publishers.
- You need aggregation or analytics on your event stream.
- You need reliable messaging or resiliency.
