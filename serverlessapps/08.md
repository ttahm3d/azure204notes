# Webhooks in Azure functions

Webhook is an automated message sent from an app when something happens (sent as http endpoint). We can use Webhhok to trigger a function

Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks. They are triggered by an event, when such event occurs, the source site makes a HTTP request to URL configured in Webhook. We can write logic in Azure functions which runs when webhook message is recieved.

## Creating a webhook for github repo

- Create a function App
- Create a HTTP Trigger
- Open github repository
- Add Webhook
  - Needs
    - Payload URL - URL of server that recieves POST request
    - ContentType (eg: application/json)
    - Events - central to Webhooks. They fire when something happens to repo and calls the URL with payload
- it emits an event with some payload
- Analyse the payload and use it according to your requirement
- We can secure the azure function to be triggered by using webhooks secrets
- `x-hub-signature` is the header we need to set to recieve it in function
