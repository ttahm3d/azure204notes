# Chaining Azure Functions together

Auzre functions allow us to connect to data and services easily. Bindings define where Azure functions read and write data. We can chain azure functions

## Bindings and Types

Bindings provide a declarative way to connect data within code. They provide an easy to integrate with data streams. We can have multiple bindigs that fetch data from various resources without coding for each of them (for API and Database we need to setup connection logics that are specific to them)

1. Input Binding - Connection to data source. Functions read data from here. Trigger is a special type of input binding
2. Output Binding - Connection to data destination. Function write data to here

### Supported Bindings

The type of binding defines from where we are reading and sending data to. Bindings can be input, output or both. (Eg. Function writes to a blob that can be a trigger for another function)

- Blob Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure service bus
- Azure Event Hubs
- External files
- External Tables
- HTTP Triggers

### Properties of Binding

1. Name: It is a function parameter using which we can access data
2. Type: The type of service we want to interact with
3. Direction: Direction of flow of data i.e., input / output
4. Connection: Provides the name of key in app settings that has connection parameters to the binding

## Creating a Binding

- Bindings are configured in JSON
- Part of function.json file

```
{
      "name": "headshotBlob",
      "type": "blob",
      "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
      "connection": "HeadshotStorageConnection",
      "direction": "in"
    },
```

name - holds the blob data

type - Blob storage

connection: App settings key name

direction: Input Binding. The binding triggers the function for any changes in `thumbnail-images` container

- Login to portal
- Create a function app
- Create a function
- Add a HTTP triiger

If we check tha function.json file, we can see that it recieves a input binding of name req type httpTrigger and is sending data with name res of type http

_Adding Blob trigger to the same function_

- Open Integration tab
- Click on `+ Add Input` option
- We can add

---

## Read data from input bindings

It is easy to connect to data source using input bindings because you dont have to write code for opening the connection or closing it.

### Types of input Bindings

- Blob storage - Blob storage bindings allow us to read data from blobs
- Azure Cosmos DB - Uses SQL API to read Cosmos DB docs
- Mobile Apps - Load data from mobile table endpoints
- Table storage

`direction` property should be `in`

### Binding Expressions

- They are specialized text part of function.json, parameters or code which is evaluated to yeild a value.
- They are usually wrapped within curly braces `{expression}` or `%<expression here%`
  `
- It is used to o resolve values from various sources

Types of binding expressions

- App settings (uses % for wrapping expression)
- Trigger file name
- Trigger metadata
- JSON payloads
- New GUID
- Current date and time

Consider the scenario as below

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/media/5-find-bookmark-flow-small.png)

The app is a lookup service. If the user wants to find about a bookmark id, they send a request. If the req is valid, check throudh Cosmos DB and return the response else send error message

Creating a COSMOS DB

- Open Portal
- Create Cosmos DB
- Provide account name - it gets appended with documents.azure.com
- API - SQL API

Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs to suit the needs of your application: SQL (document database), Gremlin (graph database), MongoDB (document database), Azure Table, and Cassandra, each of which currently require a separate account.

Inside Cosmos DB, a container holds the documents and other entities created by user.

Create a new Container

- Container requires Database ID, Throughput, Container ID and Partition Keys
- **database id** - db name. eg. func-io-cosmos
- **ThroughPut** - Requests per second. Default 4000
- **container id** - Container name: eg: bookmarks
- **partition key** - {id} The partition key specifies how the documents in Azure Cosmos DB collections are distributed across logical data partitions.

Provide the values and create a container. Under SQL API you can see your container. Select Items and click on new item from menu bar. Add the new item and provide the values

```
{
	"id":"Chess",
	"url":"https://chess.com"
}
```

Azure adds many other fields that start with an `_`(\_rid, \_self, \_etag, \_attachments, \_ts). These properties help system to manage documents

| Tag           | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| \_rid         | resource ID                     |
| \_self        | reference to the resource. URI  |
| \_etag        | for concurrency control         |
| \_attachments | path to attachments of resource |
| \_ts          | Timestamp when it was updated   |

### Adding function to read from cosmos db

- open the function created
- Open th integration tab
