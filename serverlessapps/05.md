# Creating Durable Azure Function

Durable functions are extensions of Azure functions that help us to run long stateful activities. Azure provides the infrastructure to run the function.

- Useful for creating long running
- Use serverless model and still take care of activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime concerns

## Durable functions

Durable functions enable us to implement complex stateful logic using serverless architecture. They can also be referred as stateful azure functions. They retain state between function calls.

Benefits of Durabale functions

- Scale as needed and cost effective in terms of implementing the logic
- They are event driven. They can wait for a task asynchrnously and perform chain of tasks once the task is completed
- Chain functions together
- They can be reordered.
- State can be managed.

### Orchestration Function

Durable functions provide the facility of state using Orchestration Function. Below are benefits of Orchestration function

- Workflow within code without use of any JSON desription
- Functions can be called synchronously or asynchrnously. Output is saved locally
- Azure creates chekpoints when a orchestration function awaits for an activity. It can preserve resources while the function waits

### Types of Orchestration function

1.  **Client Functions**: They are entry point for durable functinos. They run in response to an event such as HTTP request.
2.  **Orchestrator functions**: They define how the workflow needs to be executed.
3.  **Activity Functions**: It contains the actual work of tasks being orchestrated

### Application patterns

- Function chaining: All the functions are executed in a sequence

- Fan-in/ Fan-out: Runs multiple functions in parallel and waits for their output

- Async HTTP APIs: Trigger the time taking action. The client can go for other tasks and keep polling the function for output

- Monitor - Continously poll for change in state

- Human Interaction - Human interactions can be incorported in the tasks as timeouts. If said time is breached then implement automated action
