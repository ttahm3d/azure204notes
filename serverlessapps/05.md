# Creating Durable Azure Function

Durable functions are extensions of Azure functions that help us to run long lasting, stateful activities. Azure provides the infrastructure to run the function.

- Useful for creating long running functions (default timeout of azure funcitions is 5 mins)
- Use serverless model and still take care of activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime concerns

## Durable functions

Durable functions enable us to implement complex stateful logic using serverless architecture.
They can also be referred as stateful azure functions. **They retain state between function calls**.

Consider a project approval process. There may be many stages and duration at each stage is different and there is a custom logic involved. So Durable functions are the way forward for such situations

Benefits of Durabale functions

- Scale as needed and cost effective in terms of implementing the logic
- They are event driven. They can wait for a task asynchrnously and perform chain of tasks once the task is completed
- Chain functions together
- They can be reordered.
- State can be managed.

### Orchestration Function

Durable functions provide the facility of state using Orchestration Function. Below are benefits of Orchestration function

- Workflow within code without use of any JSON desription or design tool
- Functions can be called synchronously or asynchrnously. Output is saved locally
- Azure automatically creates chekpoints when a orchestration function awaits for an activity. It can preserve resources while the function waits

### Types of Orchestration function

1.  **Client Functions**: They are entry point for durable functinos. They run in response to an event such as HTTP request.
2.  **Orchestrator functions**: They define how the workflow needs to be executed.
3.  **Activity Functions**: It contains the actual work of tasks being orchestrated

### Application patterns

1. Function chaining: All the functions are executed in a sequence

2. Fan-in/ Fan-out: Runs multiple functions in parallel and waits for their output

3. Async HTTP APIs: Trigger the time taking action. The client can go for other tasks and keep polling the function for output

4. Monitor - implements a recurring process in a workflow possibly looking for change in state

5. Human Interaction - Human interactions can be incorported in the tasks as timeouts. If said time is breached then implement automated action

## Azure Logic apps vs Durable functions

|             | Azure logic apps                                               | Durable functions                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | Design first                                                   | Code first                                                 |
| Utilization | Connecting Azure services and other external services together | Custom complex logic                                       |
| Actions     | Each activity is a Azure function                              | Each activity is a predefined connector a custom connector |
| Monitoring  | App Isights                                                    | Azure Monitor and Portal                                   |
| Execution   | Run locally or in cloud                                        | only in cloud                                              |

## Desigining a Durable function

Complex workflows can be orchstrated using durable functions. Durable function can be dividied into activites and each activity performing a single task using functions

### Project Design approval process

- Design is submitted - Client Function
- Assign approval task to a manager - Orchestration function
- Approval task - activity function
- Escalation Task - activity function

### Creating a durable function

- Open Portal
- Create a function app as
  - Give name
  - give region
  - select tech stack (node)
  - Hosting tab
    - create a new storageaccount
    - Operating system Windows
    - Consumption (serverless)

Since we are creating durable functions we need to install `durable-functions` npm package

- Go to App service editors under development tools
- Create package.json file
- add below code to the file save and close (CTRL + Q)

```
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- In the azure left pane find console and run `npm install durable-functions`
- After installation is done restart the app

- Create Durable function http trigger
- Create Durable function Orchestrator Function
