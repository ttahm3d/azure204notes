# using Azure Event Hubs

Azure Event hub provides a reliable way of recieving, processing Millions of events. They are usually used in BigData environments

## Azure Event Hubs

Azure Event Hubs is a cloud-based, event-processing service that can receive and process millions of events per second. It acts as a front door to an event pipeline that recives the events and stores them until processing units are available

### Event

An event is a small part of information that contains a notification. Max size is 1MB

### Publishers and Subscribers

Event publisher sends out an event using HTTP request or AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol).

AMQP - use for frequently sending publishers

Event subscribers are apps that use one of two supported programmatic methods to receive and process events from an Event Hub.

- EventHubReceiver - A simple method that provides limited management options.
- EventProcessorHost - Complete control

### Consumer Groups

A consumer group represents a specific view of Event Hub stream. Default consumer group is enough for some apps

### Pricing

| Pricing Tier | Services                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Basic        |                            |
| Standard     | 20 CG and 1000 connections |
| Dedicated    |                            |

## Creating a Event Hub

- Create Event Hub Namespace
  - namespace level settings as below
    - capacity using throughput units (default 1)
    - pricing tier (default standard)
    - performance metrics
- URI: `<namespacename>.namespace.servicebus.windows.net`
- optional props
  - enable kafka apps to publish to Azure Event Hub
  - Zone redundant
  - Auto inflate

### CLI Commands

Creating event hubs namespace

```
az eventhubs namespace
```

`create` - create namespace

`authorization-rule` - credentials used by event hubs in the same namespace to access. returns connection string

Creating event hubs

- name - 1 to 50 char long
- Partition Count - number of partitions in event hub. Default 4. min 2 upto 32. Cannot be change later
- Message Retention - The number of days (between 1 and 7). Default 7

```
az eventhubs eventhub
```

`create` - creates

`show` - detils of event hub

## Minimum Event Hub application requirements

to send messages to an Event Hub, provide the following information, so that the application can create connection credentials:

- Event Hub namespace name
- Event Hub name
- Shared access policy name
- Primary shared access key

to receive messages from an Event Hub, provide the following information, so that the application can create connection credentials:

- Event Hub namespace name
- Event Hub name
- Shared access policy name
- Primary shared access key
- Storage account name
- Storage account connection string
- Storage account container name

storage account is required only if you want to strore the messages
