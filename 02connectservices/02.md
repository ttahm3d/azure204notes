# Implementing Message Based Communication

Using Azure Service bus in a custom application to reliably send and recieve messages between separate components

## Choosing a messaging option

Messages - Actual data is sent as payload. Strict contract between sender and reciever
Events - Pub Sub model where the subscriber is looking for event to occur. One to many communication

## Service Bus topics, queues, and relays

Service bus can exchange messages in 3 ways

- Topics
- Queues
- Relays

### Queues

Queue is a temporary storage for messages. Sending component adds message to queue and reciever takes the message out from the other end.

```
One message is typically handled by only one instance
```

Queue prevents overloading of destination

### Topics

Similar to queue. But multiple recivers can subscribe to a topic. Each message is sent to multiple recievers. Subscriptions can also filter the messages in the topic to receive only messages that are relevant

not supported in Basic pricing tier

### Relays

Bidirectional, unbuffered commpunication between components as
if they were next to each other on same network.

## Service Bus queues and storage queues

Service Bus and Storage account queues provide option to store messages in queue before they are processed.

Advantages of service bus

- larger message sizes
  - 256 KB standard tier
  - 1MB Premium tier
- At most once or atleast once
- FIFO
- Transactioal support
- Role based access control

Advantages of service bus

- Permanently store data
- 80Gbsize queue

## Creating Service Bus and Service Bus Queue Topics

### Create Azure service bus namespace

logical container with a qualified domain name. Each space has SAS keys. senders and recievers need to use these keys while using these Bus queues

- Open portal
- Search service bus
- Create a namespace

### Create a service bus

- Open the resource
- Select Queue at top and add new queue

### Create a service bus topics

- Open namespace
- Add topic
- After creating it we need to add subscriptions to the topic
- Goto entities
- Select the topic created and add subscription (need to do oneat a time)

## Writing Code

Microsoft provides Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus nuget package to write code to use these queues and topics. `QueueClient` class is used to connect to queue

messages should be UTF-8 encoded string

Soruce and destination need

- connection string - the endpoint of service bus
- access key

Steps for Queues

- use asynchronous methods to call the queues.
- Need to register a handler at reciever
  ```
  queueClient.RegisterMessageHandler(MessageHandler, messageHandlerOptions);
  ```
- remove message from queue
  ```
  await queueClient.CompleteAsync(message.SystemProperties.LockToken)
  ```

Steps for Topics

- use `TopicClient ` package instead of `QueryClient`
- use asynchronous methods to call the queues.
- We can control messages delivered to a subscription using filters on subscription
  1.  Boolean Filters - TrueFilter - messages are delivered to the subscriptions
  2.  SQL Filters - sql where clause based filter
  3.  Correlation Filter - set of conditions that are matched against the properties of each messag
- creating a topic
  ```
  topicClient = new TopicClient(TextAppConnectionString, "GroupMessageTopic");
  ```
- TopicClient.SendAsync() to send message
  ```
  await topicClient.SendAsync(encodedMessage);
  ```
- To receive messages, you must create a `SubscriptionClient` object
  ```
  subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient(ServiceBusConnectionString, "GroupMessageTopic", "NorthAmerica");
  ```
- register handler
  ```
  subscriptionClient.RegisterMessageHandler(MessageHandler, messageHandlerOptions);
  ```
- Remove from queu
  ```
  await subscriptionClient.CompleteAsync(message.SystemProperties.LockToken);
  ```
