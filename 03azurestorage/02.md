# Creating a Storage Account

## Azure Storage

Azure provides multiple ways to store data.

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Tables
- Queues
- Blobs
- File Storage

Four of these grouped together, because they are primitive and are usually used together in an app, form Azure storage

## Storage account

Storage account is a container that groups azure services together

- Blob
- Queue
- Tables
- Files

- Allows us to manage them as group
- Settings are applied to all things in the account
- Azure SQL and Cosmos DB cannot be included in storage account

### Storage account settings

- Subscription
- Resource Group
- Location
- Performance - Determines the data services you can have in storage account
  - Standard - uses HDD
  - Premium - uses SSD - provides append blobs, page blobs
- Replication
  - Replicates data in same data center by default and maintains 3 copies of data
  - LRS - same data center
  - GRS - Different data centers
- Access Tier
  - Hot - frequent data - quick access
  - Cold - infrequent data - slow access
- Secure transfer - enabled ? HTTPS : HTTP

### Cost

A storage account by itself has no financial cost; however, the settings you choose for the account do influence the cost of services in the account. Geo-redundant storage costs more than locally-redundant storage. Premium performance and the Hot access tier increase the cost of blobs.

### Key Settings

- Name

  - each storage account should have a globally unique name
  - 3- 24 characters in length

- Deployment model

  - System used by azure to organize resources
    - Resouce Manager API - Resouce Manager
      - Allows grouping of resources using RG
    - Azure service management API - Classic

- Account Kind

  Determines the data services available

  - StorageV2 - All features and all types
  - Storage - All Types but not all new features
  - Blob - Allows only block blobs and append blobs
