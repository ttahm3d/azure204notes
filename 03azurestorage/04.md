# Secure Azure Storage account

Azure Storage provides fine grained control over the Blobs, files, Tables and queues created in Azure Storage account. Azure storage provides

- protection to data at rest
- protection in transit
- CORS support
- RB control access to data
- Audit storage access

## Protection At Rest

- All data in Azure Storage is encrypted using SSE - storage service encryption with 256 bit AES Cipher
- Encrypts while writing to storage
- Decrypts when being read from storage
- For VMs Azure allows us to encrpyrt hard disks using Azure Disk Encryption
  - bitlocker for windows
  - dm-crypt for linux
- AKV stores the keys for encryption

### Encryption in Transit

- We can enable Transport Level Security (TLS)
- Provides HTTPS mode for transport

### CORS

To secure browser apps, Contoso locks GET requests down to specific domains. Azure Storage supports cross-domain access through cross-origin resource sharing

### RBAC

- Every request needs to be authorized
- Azure storage supports AD (only for Blob and Queue) and RBAC for data access and resouce management
- We can assign the RBAC to security principle and use it across the storage account

### Auditing

- Builtin storage analytics
- Every operation in realtime

---

## Storage account Keys

AD Auth can be used with blob and queues. For other storage types, we need to use Storage account keys

- 2 keys are created for each account
- they can be rotated while other is being used

The client embeds these keys in HTTP authorization header and sends a request to the storage account

### Protecting the keys

The Storage account keys provide access to everything
If you feel they are compromised for any reasons we can change them and create new ones. This is easy becuse while the key is being changed we can use the secondary key

## Shared Access Signature

For untrusted clients, we can use SAS token. It is a security token that can be added to an URI to provide fine grain access to the URI - constraints, permissions, valid thru date

### Types of SAS Tokens

1. Service Level

   - Allow access to a specific resource

2. Account level
   - Access to any resource in storage account

## Control Network access

- storage accounts accept connection from clients on any network by default
- we can restrict to specific IP address or VNET

## Threat Protection

- Azure Defender provides extra layer of protection on top of storage account
- Detects unusual and harmful attempt to access
- Triggers alerts in case of anomalies
- Integrated with Azure Security Center
- Azure Defender for Storage is currently available for Blob storage, Azure Files, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Supported by Genral Purpose V2 and Blob type accounts
