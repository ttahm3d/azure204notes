# Developing for Azure Storage

Azure provides multiple way of storing and retriving data of various types

- Relational
- NoSQL
- Structured
- Archival

## Classifying data

An application such as a Retail store has multiple types of data. And there are multiple storage options available in Azure which can be leveraged to get best out of everything

All kinds of data can be stored in cloud

- Files
- Blobs
- Queues
- Tables
- Application Data
  - Structured
  - Semi Structured
  - Unstructured

Azure Storage - for files, documents, images that are served
Azure SQL - Relational database
Azure COSMOS DB -Structured, Semi Structured, Unstructured. Document, Graph based DB, Key Value Stores

- Structured Data

  Data with Structure. Called as relational-database. There is a schema with constraints. Can be queried using SQL

- Semi-structured data

  Less organised. Data contains tags such as Key Value pairs. It is also called as NoSQL data. Requires a serialization language - XML, JSON, YAML

- Unstructure data

  Files such as images/ videos

Determine the operational needs of data

- Query requirements
- Number of operations
- Complex analytical Queries
- Speed of operations

### Transactions

Updates can be grouped into transactions. They help in maintain data consistency across the database
