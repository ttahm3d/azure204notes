# Creating a Windows VM

- Can be created using Portal, CLI / Powershell, ARM templates
- Choose size
  - Starting from B-series (testing) upto H for High performance computing.
  - Can resize later but VM needs to be stopped
    - genral usage - B and D
    - Computational tasks - F
    - High memory usage - E, G, M
    - Big Data - Ls
    - Graphics - N
    - High performance - H
- Choose disks
  - SSD - premium of intensive IO or else standard
  - HDD - general purposes
- Mapping drives
  - Disks are VHD's - logically work as disks but stored as pages in blob storage
  - two disks by default
    - OS Disk - 2048 GB capacity. `C:/ drive`
    - Temporary disk - `D:/ drive` used for windows paging
- Network
  - Vnet is created that has all resouces that VM can communicate with
