# Azure Function Core Tools

Azure function core tools are command line tools that help us build the function locally annd publish to azure.

Genral features:

- generate files and folders required to develop functions locally
- Run locally
- Publish to azure

They are packaged into command line utilty called `func`. Running func looks like below

This is a standalone tool for CLI or Powershell. Other features VS Code Functions is built on top of this tool

## Creating functions locally

- All functions are part of function app. It contains all the functions that share same configuration
- When you develop functions locally, you createa function project equivalent of function app.
- we need to create a folder to organise the functions

### Steps to create

1. Run `func init` inside a folder you will be prompted to select runtime
2. many files are created depending on runtime but two common files
   - host.json - runtime configuration file. eg logging options
   - local.settings.json - settings that apply to function when it is running locally
3. Add a new function using `func new` - gives trigger options and to provide a name to the function

### Running locally

- functions need to be hosted by function host
- run `func start` from functions directory (main directory)
- gives the localurl

### Publishing to Azure

- Need to create a function app from CLI before publishing
- run `func azure functionapp publish <app_name>`
