# Cloud types and Azure Service Models

Cloud computing provides configurable resources such as compute, networks and storages that can provisioned quickly. The resources are abstract and the user gets to have his services up and runnning

There are three deployment models

- Public cloud
- Hybrid cloud
- Private Cloud

- Legacy applications may not run

### Private Cloud

Setup cloud in your datacenter

1.  Infrastructure as a Service

    Most flexible option. Control over OS. Also called as Shared responsibility model because the cloud provider is responsible for ensuring the cloud infrastructure is functioning correctly; the cloud customer is responsible for ensuring the service they are using is configured correctly, is up to date, and is available to their customers.

    Ex: For migration, quickly set up test and development environments.

2.  Platform as a Service

    Provides a environment for developing and deploying applications onto cloud without bothering about the underlying OS.

3.  Software as a service

    Already developed software hosted on cloud and used by users.
