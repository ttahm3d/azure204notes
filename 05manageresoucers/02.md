# Controling Azure services using Azure CLI

Azure portal is a GUI for interacting with Azure services. But Cannot be effectively used for repetative tasks.

Azure CLI is one of the command line tools that can be used to interact with Azure Resouces . It is a cross platform tool. It can also be used in browser in the form of cloud shell

## What Azure resources can be managed using the Azure CLI?

The Azure CLI lets you control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource. You can work with resource groups, storage, virtual machines, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), containers, machine learning, and so on

The commands are grouped in groups and subgroups. Each group represents a service provided by Azure, and the subgroups divide commands for these services into logical groupings

- groups - like storage account
- subgroup - like blob, queue,

List all resource groups

```
az group list
```

List all resource groups in table

```
az group list --output table
```
