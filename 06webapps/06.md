# Containerized Web Apps

We can deploy Azure Web Apps as containerized instances.

## Azure Container Registery

Azure Container Registery allows us to store docker images in cloud in a Azure storage account.

- Container Registery used to create Docker images
- Works like docker hub for web apps
- redeploys when an image is rebuilt

Contianer Registery vs Docker hub

- Secure - regulate access
- sign images to imporve trust
- encrypted at rest
- Container Registry stores images
- highly scalable, providing enhanced throughput

**Premium SKU of container registery: 500 GiB**

### Creating a container registery

- Open portal
- Select containers
- select container registery
- provide region, name, SKU size

This image can be deployed to Azure Container Instances

The image added to container registery has tags. Latest build of registery has `latest` tag

### Creating Web app from container image

- Open the Web app creation wizard
- Select docker for deployment instead of code and select the OS and region
- We need to enable the access on ACR image and get username and password

We need to provide

1. Registry where image is stored
2. Image
3. Tag - indicates which version to be used from repo
4. Startup file - if it is a not ready to run containerised app

## Continous deployment with Web Hooks

Azure App service supports CD with webhooks.
It is a service offered by ACR
Services can subscribe to this webhook and get latest images

### Taks Feature

It is used to rebuild the image once a new image is avaialable in ACR
Turn on Continous Deploy button in container settings to support CD
