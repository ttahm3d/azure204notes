# Scaling Web apps

Scaling is important as it puts lot of pressure on the resources when there is high demand and we waste resources when demand is less.

App service provides

| Scale Up   | Increase instances                                  | change the pricing tier of app service plan |
| Scale Down | Decrease instances                                  | change the pricing tier of app service plan |
| Scale Out  | Increase the resources on which instance is running | change using slider                         |
| Scale In   | Decrease the resources on which instance is running | change using slider                         |

## Scaling manually

You can manually scale the app to meet the demand based on the metrics.

Web app in azure runs on Azure app service. These app services can spin up multiple instances and load balance internally. Each instance on a separate VM.

Resources available for each instance is defined by Azure service plan.

| Plan     | Space | Number of apps | Quota                   | SLA    | Shared              | Scaling                             |     |
| -------- | ----- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --- |
| Free     | 1GB   | 10             | 60 min per app per day  | No     | Yes single instance | No                                  |
| Shared   |       | 60             | 240 min per app per day | No     | yes single instance | No                                  |

## Monitoring

You monitor the performance of a web app by using the metrics available for the App Service.

- CPU utilization
- memory occupancy
- disk queue length
- Request Response times
- Number of failing requests

Enable logging in Diagnostic Logs
