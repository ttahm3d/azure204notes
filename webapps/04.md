# Deploying to test and using deployment slots

There may be a requirement to change or upgrade the existing web app. We can do it easily by making use of deployment slots. We can deploy the app to a test deployment slot and swap it with production once it is completed.

## Creating a Deployment slot

A single azure web app can have multiple deployment slots. Each deployment slots its own instance, URL.

First slot is the production slot. The one that users see when they hit the URL. Initially it will run with 100% quota.

- Open Azure Portal
- Open the App service app / create one
- In the settings panel, search for deployment slots
- Create a Deployment slot for your need
- Perform upgrades and test
- Swap the slots

Swapping is instantaneous. You can roll back to previous version by swapping again.

Each slot is treated as separate instance. Each has its own URL. They share the same resources as defined in App service plan.

| Plan       | Deployment slots |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| free       | 0                |
| shared     | 0                |
| Basic      | 0                |
| Standard   | 5                |
| Premium    | 20               |
| Premium V2 | 20               |
| isolated   | 20               |

Avoids cold starts - code is compiled before request is furnished. Swaps help in avoiding cold starts as the swap warms up the app by sending a request to root of the app
