## App Service Plan

App service plan gives Azure Compute Units. It defines the

- compute resources that your application will consume
- location of resources
- Additional resources that can be utilised
- pricing tier

App service plan can have one or more apps running on them

Each App Service plan defines:

- Region (West US, East US, and so on)
- Number of VM instances
- Size of VM instances (small, medium, large)
- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, Premium V2, Isolated)

Free and Shared - In this tier the app service runs on the same compute resources as the other apps even those of other customers. CPU quota is allocated. They cannot scale out.
165MB Outbound data for 24 hrs.

Basic, Standard, Premium, Premium V2 - All of these run on dedicated VMs. Only apps from same app service plan can share the compute resources

Isolated - Dedicated VMs on dedicated VNets. Maximum scale out capabilities. To be used when

- The app is resource-intensive
- You want to scale the app independently from the other apps in the existing plan
- The app needs resources in a different geographical region
